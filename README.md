# Maths for Data Science
My Notetaking for new content learned from Steve Brunton's series on different Data Science topics based on his book: Data Driven Science and Engineering
This Journaling will help me improve / brush up my linear algebra and statistics as well as get me familiar with the Obsidian note taking system.

Following contents are recorded in this *Journal*

These notes are best understood with the help of such Markdown previewing softwares / sites rather than raw GitHub files.
* HOWEVER, I will still try to reformat the files for better GitHub viewing experience :D
